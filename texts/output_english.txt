yesterday, i went to the st0re to buy somethng for dinner. i needed bre4d, milk, 
and a few other things. when i got there, i picked up a loaf of 
bread for $2.50 and a gallon of milk for $3.79 (it was suposed to be 
$3.59, but the price tag was wrong). then, i saw a pack of cookies for 
$4.99, but the expiraton date said "12/15," and today is 12/13. i thought, "hmm, maybe 
i shuld take the risk." at the checkout, i realized i had forgotten my wallet 
at home 🤦‍♂️. i only had $20 in cash, but the total came to $18.67. 
the cashier asked, "do you need change?" i said, "no, keep it." but then i 
regretted it because i could've used the 33 cents later 😅. on my way home, 
i ran into my old frend mike. he said he’d be at the park at 
3:00 pm tomorrow and asked if i wanted to meet up. i said yes, but 
i forgot to ask which park — central park or liberty park. now i’ll have 
to text him, but my phone battery is at 15%, and i don’t have my 
charger with me. when i got home, i decided to cook dinner. i opened the 
fridge and found some chicken that had been sitting there for like 4 days. i 
thought, "i should probably cook this before it goes bad." i heated up a pan 
and poured oil, but i accidentally poured too much. the chicken started sizzling and almost 
burned. in the end, i added potatoes and onions, and after 40 minutes, everything was 
ready. it tasted good, but it was a bit too salty. after dinner, i sat 
down at my computer to do some work. i was supposed to write a report 
for my boss, but instead, i started browsing socila media. i read an article saying 
that next year, inflation might reach 7%. that scared me because wages aren’t going up 
fast enough. after wasting 30 minutes, i finally started writing the report, but after 10 
minutes, i realized i hadn’t saved the file, and it disappeared! i had to start 
all over again 😡. overall, it was a long and tiring day. but before bed, 
i watched two episodes of my favorite show — it helped me relax. i went 
to bed at 11:45 pm, but i couldn’t fall asleep because i kept thinking about 
waking up early tomorrow. i need to be at work by 8:30 am, so i 
set my alarm for 6:45. oh, and i can’t forget about meeting mike at the 
park... i hope i don’t oversleep!
