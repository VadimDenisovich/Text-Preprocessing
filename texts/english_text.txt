Yesterday, I went to the st0re to buy somethng for dinner. I needed bre4d, milk, and a few other things. When I got there, I picked up a loaf of bread for $2.50 and a gallon of milk for $3.79 (it was suposed to be $3.59, but the price tag was wrong). Then, I saw a pack of cookies for $4.99, but the expiraton date said "12/15," and today is 12/13. I thought, "Hmm, maybe I shuld take the risk."

At the checkout, I realized I had forgotten my wallet at home 🤦‍♂️. I only had $20 in cash, but the total came to $18.67. The cashier asked, "Do you need change?" I said, "No, keep it." But then I regretted it because I could've used the 33 cents later 😅.

On my way home, I ran into my old frend Mike. He said he’d be at the park at 3:00 PM tomorrow and asked if I wanted to meet up. I said yes, but I forgot to ask which park — Central Park or Liberty Park. Now I’ll have to text him, but my phone battery is at 15%, and I don’t have my charger with me.

When I got home, I decided to cook dinner. I opened the fridge and found some chicken that had been sitting there for like 4 days. I thought, "I should probably cook this before it goes bad." I heated up a pan and poured oil, but I accidentally poured too much. The chicken started sizzling and almost burned. In the end, I added potatoes and onions, and after 40 minutes, everything was ready. It tasted good, but it was a bit too salty.

After dinner, I sat down at my computer to do some work. I was supposed to write a report for my boss, but instead, I started browsing socila media. I read an article saying that next year, inflation might reach 7%. That scared me because wages aren’t going up fast enough. After wasting 30 minutes, I finally started writing the report, but after 10 minutes, I realized I hadn’t saved the file, and it disappeared! I had to start all over again 😡.

Overall, it was a long and tiring day. But before bed, I watched two episodes of my favorite show — it helped me relax. I went to bed at 11:45 PM, but I couldn’t fall asleep because I kept thinking about waking up early tomorrow. I need to be at work by 8:30 AM, so I set my alarm for 6:45. Oh, and I can’t forget about meeting Mike at the park... I hope I don’t oversleep!
